<!-- we use property binding with square brackets (dom object) to bind them to fields in our host components -->
<!-- <img [src]="imageUrl" /> <button (click)="onClick()"></button> -->

<!-- property bindings w the dom and host component will not work-->
<!-- in order to use property binding within Angular, you must define the property as an input -->
<favorite
  [isFavorite]="post.isFavorite"
  (change)="onFavoriteChange()"
></favorite>
